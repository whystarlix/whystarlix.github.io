### *Checkpost Arduino*:
A simple arduino checkpost project, for a friend. Original code is from @SimpleCircuits, where I reposted and relicensed with permission. 

I fixed up the code and helped out with setting it up

### *Air-Mouse-Glove*:
Took rm10078's project and adapted it to work with a glove. I also made the buttons into touch sensors using esp32's builtin touch pins used to activate the mouse function through the MPU6050
