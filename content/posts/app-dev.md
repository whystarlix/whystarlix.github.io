### *UPI Viewer*: 

A simple frontend for a UPI Powered Point of Sale System - Without using any external services or APIs!

Written in Kotlin, it makes phones as old as Android 4.2 into a fully functional minimal Point of Sale machine with features like "Dynamic QR Generator", " Split the Bill" mode, etc.

This is ZeusInstitute OSS's first big project. I want to try to get it on F-Droid after alpha and try to get it on Play Store after stable release. I regularly post updates on both [linkedin](https://linkedin.com/in/souhrud-reddy) and [my fediverse profile](https://infosec.exchange/@sounddrill)

### *GPS Picture*:
A simple android camera app that overlays Location and date on the picture. There is a real need for this, especially in educational institutions to verify that sessions were actually conducted, and on time. 

Only apps that worked that met these needs were closed source apps with very annoying intrusive ads, so I wanted to make my own.
