This project aims to port Super Mario 64 to the PlayStation 2, after it was decompiled. 

For a while, it refused to work on recent sdk versions on real hardware, despite improving performance. 

Made a few tweaks as suggested by @metchebe and @xdccrlz [here](https://github.com/fgsfdsfgs/sm64-port/issues/72#issuecomment-1265325542) and maintained it for a while. Also made a helper script to package it into an iso for easy OpenPS2Loader use!

The upstream repo seems to have fixed this issue, but when I tried it, my save got wiped :(   
- Still, I got pretty far in and enjoyed the game quite a bit!
